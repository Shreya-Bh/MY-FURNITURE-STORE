# MyFurnitureStore

MyFurnitureStore is an exemplary project that demonstrates my capabilities as a developer by creating a fully functional and responsive online furniture store using Wix. The website features a modern design optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a seamless user experience across all platforms.

The store includes comprehensive product listings with detailed descriptions, pricing, and high-quality images. Users can easily browse through the catalog, add items to their shopping cart, and proceed to a secure checkout process. Customer account management allows users to create accounts, view order histories, and manage personal information.

A notable feature is the customer review section, where users can leave feedback on their purchases, enhancing the store's credibility and user engagement.

Overall, MyFurnitureStore not only highlights my technical skills in using Wix, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 but also my ability to create user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing e-commerce websites.
